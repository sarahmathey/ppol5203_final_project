    "Script below takes health indicators from https://data.hrsa.gov/maps/mchb and specifies the important columns, aggregating all sheets into one excel file.  Download each health indicator per state and get all the county data for them. Note: only works for specific columns in \"columns_to_keep\" variable- can subtract from this, but I don't recommend adding without expecting to make some adjustments for different sized data."
